### 👋 Hi, I'm Arindam

Independent researcher focused on first-principles understanding of AI/ML, algorithms, and computational systems.  
I follow the rigor of MIT’s 6-4 curriculum to build a unified foundation across mathematics, computation, and intelligent systems.

My work blends theoretical depth with systems-level engineering — treating learning as a research problem, driven by proofs, experiments, and transparent documentation.
