# Hi, I'm Arindam 👋

I am a systems & computational learner focused on translating
**theory → implementation** through code, simulation, and experimentation.

My interests span:
- Embedded systems
- Computational physics
- Mathematical & algorithmic thinking
- Programming as a tool for understanding systems
